Purchase Document Deletion Protection

Implements SARS audit trail requirements by preventing deletion of
non-consecutive purchase documents (Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt, Purchase Invoice).

Per SARS regulations, businesses must maintain consecutive numbering of
purchase documents for tax audit purposes. This module only allows deletion
of the most recent document in a naming series to preserve the audit trail.
